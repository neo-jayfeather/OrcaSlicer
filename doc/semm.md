# Single Extruder Multi-Material Printing in OrcaSlicer

## Introduction
In this guide, we will explain the parameters for single extruder multimaterial printing in OrcaSlicer. The whole process and parameters are same as PrusaSlicer as OrcaSlicer is based on PrusaSlicer (with features ported from Bambu Studio and Cura). OrcaSlicer has some additional features ande G-Code for BBL machines. 

## Ramming
### *Note: This section does not apply to BBL printers, unless you are trying to use the AMS like an MMU*
Ramming is forming the tip of the filament by purging filament. 

## Manual filament change
If your printer does not have multi-material/filament switching capabilities, you can still print multicolor prints using manual filament changes, where pauses will be added for manual filament changes.
