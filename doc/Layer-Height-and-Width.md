# Layer Height
Layer height defines how thick each slice is, and how much the Z axis moves when the printer is finished with on layer. It is usually recommended for it to not exceed the nozzle diameter, and usually is 1/4 to 1/2 of the nozzle's diameter.
The first layer's height can be thickened to increase bed adhesion or to assist with very minor bed leveling issues. 

# Line Width
These parameters control how thick lines are. The lines are defined by their type, like walls, surfaces, and infill.
### Default
The default line width. It will be overrided by the parameters below in their respective scenarios. 
### First Layer
The line width for first layers-- it's usually larger to help it be more compressive and be slightly faster.
### Outer Wall
The line width for outer walls.
### Inner Wall
The line width for inner walls.
### Top Surface
The line width for top surfaces.
### Internal Solid Infill
The line width for internal solid infill.
### Support
The line width for support structures.
